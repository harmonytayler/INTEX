        <p>One winter when Jen was homeless, seven of her friends froze to death. <br>Jen is no longer homeless and has figured out a solution:
            <br>high tech foam vests that are inexpensive,
            keep a person warm to 10 degree below zero, help SAVE lives and alleviate suffering.</p>
        <br><p>You can request vests for your community - 
            and you can make vests and have your friends, business colleagues, church members or club make vests, too!</p>
        <br><p>What is a turtle shelter vest? A high tech but simple solution to help save lives -
            a portable "shelter" you can carry with you, just like a turtle...
            and YOU can help!</p>
